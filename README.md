# the_lazy_soc
My tools to "troubleshooting" as I am lazy.....

So the goal of this script is to automate some simple task that will help in the troubleshooting of compromissed machines.

Tasks that I am currently working on : 

 1 - List Services and detailed information of the machine
 2 - Remote copy via ssh and fast deployment of the scrinpt in the infected machine.
